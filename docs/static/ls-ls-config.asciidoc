=== Configuring Logstash-to-Logstash Communication

In a complex network environment, you may need two Logstash machines talking to each other. That is, the output from the first Logstash machine becomes the input for the second Logstash machine. You may need this configuration if the data path crosses network or firewall boundaries, for example.

NOTE: Don't complicate your configuration unnecessarily. If you don't have a compelling need for Logstash-to-Logstash communication, then don't implement it.

[[ls-to-ls-overview]]
==== Configuration overview

. Use the Lumberjack output plugin on the first Logstash machine.
. Use the Beats input plugin on the second Logstash machine.
. Generate a trusted SSL certificate (required by the lumberjack protocol).
. Save the SSL certificate on the first Logstash machine.
. Save the SSL certificate and key on the second Logstash machine.
. Test it.

[[generate-self-signed-cert]]
===== Generate a self-signed SSL certificate and key

You can use the `openssl req` command with some specific flags to generate a self-signed certificate and key. The `openssl req` command is available on any operating system that comes with SSL.

Run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
openssl req -x509 -batch -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout lumberjack.key -out lumberjack.crt -subj /CN=localhost
----

where:

* `lumberjack.key` specifies the name of the SSL key to be created
* `lumberjack.cert` specifies the name of the SSL certificate to be created
* `localhost` specifies the name of the first Logstash computer


This command produces output similar to the following:

[source,shell]
----
Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
.................................+++
....................+++
writing new private key to 'lumberjack.key'
----

[[save-cert-ls1]]
===== Save the SSL certificate on the first Logstash machine

On the first Logstash machine, run the following command:
[source,shell]
----
bin/logstash --path.data /tmp/z -e 'input { generator { count => 5 } } output { lumberjack { codec => json hosts => "localhost" ssl_certificate => "lumberjack.crt" port => 5000 } }'
----

where:

* `5` specifies the number of events you want to generate and send
* `lumberjack.cert` specifies the name of the SSL certificate you created
* `localhost` specifies the name of the first Logstash computer

[[save-cert-ls2]]
===== Save the SSL certificate and key on the second Logstash machine

On the second Logstash machine, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
bin/logstash -e 'input {beats { codec =>? json port => 5000 ssl => ssl_certificate => "lumberjack.crt" ssl_key => "lumberjack.key"} }'
----

where:

* `lumberjack.key` specifies the name of the SSL key to be created
* `lumberjack.cert` specifies the name of the SSL certificate to be created
* `localhost` specifies the name of the computer

[[test-ls-to-ls]]
===== Test the communication

Use the input generator to send test events from the first Logstash machine.

The following command sends five events over port 5000:

[source,shell]
----
bin/logstash â€”path.data /tmp/z -e 'input { generator {count => 5 } } output { lumberjack { codec => json hosts => "localhost" ssl_certificate => "lumberjack.crt" Port => 5000 } }'
----

Watch the second Logstash machine for the incoming events. You should see five incrementing events similar to the following:

[source,shell]
----
{
  "@timestamp" => 2018-02-07T12:16:39.415Z,
  "sequence"   => 0
  "tags"       => [
    [0] "beats_input_codec_json_applied"
  ],
  "message"    => "Hello world",
  "@version"   => "1",
  "host"       => "ls1.semicomplete.com"
}
----
If you see all five events with consistent fields and formatting, incrementing by one, then your configuration is correct.
