== Configuring Logstash

To configure Logstash, you create a config file that specifies which plugins you want to use and settings for each plugin.
You can reference event fields in a configuration and use conditionals to process events when they meet certain
criteria. When you run logstash, you use the `-f` to specify your config file.

Let's step through creating a simple config file and using it to run Logstash. Create a file named "logstash-simple.conf" and save it in the same directory as Logstash.

[source,ruby]
----------------------------------
input { stdin { } }
output {
  elasticsearch { hosts => ["localhost:9200"] }
  stdout { codec => rubydebug }
}
----------------------------------

Then, run logstash and specify the configuration file with the `-f` flag.

[source,ruby]
----------------------------------
bin/logstash -f logstash-simple.conf
----------------------------------

Et voil√†! Logstash reads  the specified configuration file and outputs to both Elasticsearch and stdout. Note that if you see a message in stdout that reads "Elasticsearch Unreachable" that you will need to make sure Elasticsearch is installed and up and reachable on port 9200. Before we
move on to some <<config-examples,more complex examples>>, let's take a closer look at what's in a config file.
