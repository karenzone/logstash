=== Plugin configuration

The configuration of a plugin consists of the plugin name followed
by a block of settings for that plugin. For example, this input section configures two file inputs:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
input {
  file {
    path => "/var/log/messages"
    type => "syslog"
  }

  file {
    path => "/var/log/apache/access.log"
    type => "apache"
  }
}
----------------------------------

In this example, two settings are configured for each of the file inputs: 'path' and 'type'.

The settings you can configure vary according to the plugin type. For information about each plugin, see <<input-plugins,Input Plugins>>, <<output-plugins, Output Plugins>>, <<filter-plugins,Filter Plugins>>, and <<codec-plugins,Codec Plugins>>.
